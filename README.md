# Acronyms
I use the following acronyms in this document
* EADS: External account data source
* EPDS: External prices data source

# Features
The following list of features is as of ''2015-10-11''
* add accounts manually or linked to EADS
 * gets "average cost" for a security for the "performance" field
* add securities for allocation
* prices
 * automatic price update for securities from EADS
 * or fetching prices for specified date from EPDS
  * shows "try again" if EADS or EPDS unavailable
 * or can fetch "latest" prices from EPDS
 * Management of prices by deleting old/new prices when more than 1 price is available for a security
* single-button select of security price dates (latest or other available date) .. also can automatically set to last available before this date
* lists trades required for meeting allocation
* add multiple strategies for different accounts
* app data
 * save locally and to server
 * app versioning and data versioning
  * UI alert when server fails to save to server
  * saving to server requires submitting the current data version, which should match with the current data version on the server, and which fails if not
* Can set performances for strategies and accounts
 * Account performance is time-weighted return
* Editing a security has "Test ISIN from EPDS"
* Partial redemption / subscription
* Trades default view, pooled by security/sign (buy or sell), single account
* Incorporating currencies of securities into total funds
 * as of today (2015-10-10), for accounts from EADS, FX rates come straight from EADS and are treated like the number of shares
* each security in its own currency
 * returned price from EPDS now includes quoted currency
 * alert if mismatching currencies between allocations from EADS and prices from EPDS or inconsistency in any of these two
* only server interaction for EPDS prices and EADS positions
* can set a "manual" class for a security that is not overridden by the EADS refresh (which overrides the "original" class)
* Check server-side below for a list of features that are server-side and which can be configured in the app

# Installation

    sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm git mercurial
    sudo npm install -g bower
    make install

# Server-side
The app can fetch/submit data to external sources accepting the corresponding data structures.
The external sources are API end-points installed on a server.
They can augment the app's features with the following:
* saving the app data to the server to be shared with other users of the app
 * Note that this API end-point requires the data as well as the parent data version
* fetching account data from an EADS (check Acronyms section at top)
* fetching prices from an EPDS (check Acronyms section at top)
* exporting the server-saved data to excel

I will write more on the API end-points data format later
